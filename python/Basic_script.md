### python之禅

```
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

### python测试链接mysql

```python
[root@mysql ~]# cat test_python_mysql.py 
#!/usr/bin/python3
import pymysql

db = pymysql.connect(host='192.168.6.79',
                        port=3307,
                        user='root',
                        password='1234',
                        db='mysql',
                        charset='utf8')

cursor=db.cursor()
cursor.execute("Select version()")

data=cursor.fetchone()

print("数据库链接正确，数据库版本是:%s"%data)
db.close()

```

### 年龄计算

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import time
from calendar import isleap

# judge the leap year
def judge_leap_year(year):
    if isleap(year):
        return True
    else:
        return False


# returns the number of days in each month
def month_days(month, leap_year):
    if month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:
        return 31
    elif month in [4, 6, 9, 11]:
        return 30
    elif month == 2 and leap_year:
        return 29
    elif month == 2 and (not leap_year):
        return 28


name = input("input your name: ")
age = input("input your age: ")
localtime = time.localtime(time.time())

year = int(age)
month = year * 12 + localtime.tm_mon
day = 0

begin_year = int(localtime.tm_year) - year
end_year = begin_year + year

# calculate the days
for y in range(begin_year, end_year):
    if (judge_leap_year(y)):
        day = day + 366
    else:
        day = day + 365

leap_year = judge_leap_year(localtime.tm_year)
for m in range(1, localtime.tm_mon):
    day = day + month_days(m, leap_year)

day = day + localtime.tm_mday
print("%s's age is %d years or " % (name, year), end="")
print("%d months or %d days" % (month, day))
```

#### 获取网站ip和主机名

```python
# importing socket library
import socket

def get_hostname_IP():
    hostname = input("Please enter website address(URL):")
    try:
        print (f'Hostname: {hostname}')
        print (f'IP: {socket.gethostbyname(hostname)}')
    except socket.gaierror as error:
        print (f'Invalid Hostname, error raised is {error}')

get_hostname_IP()
```
